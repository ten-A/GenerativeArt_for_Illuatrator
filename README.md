# GenerativeArt_for_Illuatrator

The scripts for GenerativeArt in this repository are well-known and have already been implemented in various ways by various people. 
This time, these were newly created in a form adapted to Adobe Illustrator ver.29.
Most of them contain deep recursion and are therefore highly loaded scripts. Please be aware that they may hang when executed.
I would like to thank the researcher who developed these theories and implementations on which it is based.

Some samples are explained in the Blog.
